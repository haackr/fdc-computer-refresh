      <h2 class="display-4">Introduction</h2>
      <p>The new computers will be arriving soon, so now is the time to start backing up your data so you are ready when our new computers arrive. The two most important things to backup are your <a href="#files">files</a> and your <a href="#pst">outlook data file(s)</a>.
        You may also wish to backup any <a href="#bookmarks">bookmarks</a> you have in the web browsers that you use.</p>

      <h2 class="display-4" id="files">Backing up your files</h2>
      <p>The first thing you should do is make sure that all of your important files are copied somewhere where they will be accessible on your new computer. My reccomendation is to move your Documents, Downloads, Photos, and Desktop folders to a backup
        folder on your U: drive. If you'd prefer you could copy them to a thumb drive instead. My instructions from now on will assume you are backing up on the U: drive, but it should be simple enough to apply them to another backup location.</p>
      <p>In windows explorer go to <code>C:/Users/e######</code> where "######" is your employee number. Copy the relevant folders to your backup folder on the U: drive. If you have store documents elsewhere on your hard drive you should also move those
        to the U: drive.</p>

      <div class="alert alert-danger">
        <strong>Warning!</strong> If you store documents anywhere other than Downloads, My Documents, and Pictures (such as directly in your C: drive) you should back those up as well. If you only followed the instructions above, you will not have backed
        up those files and you should do so now.

      <h2 class="display-4" id="pst">Backing up your Outlook .pst file</h2>
      <p>If you move your emails to a locally stored file in Outlook (usually called "Archive" or "Personal Folders", you'll want to back that up too. To find out where that file is stored, in Outlook, click <code>File > Account Settings > Account Settings</code>        and then go to the <code>Data Files</code> tab. There will be at least one item that has the same name as your email address. Any other items there need to be backed up if they are not already stored on the U: drive. Likely they will be in <code>C:\User\e######\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook\</code>.
        The easiest way to navigate to the folder where you .pst file is stored is by selecting the file and clicking the "Open File Location..." button. Now close the Data Files dialog and Outlook. Then copy the .pst file(s) to your U: drive.</p>

      <h2 class="display-4" id="bookmarks">Exporting your bookmarks</h2>
      <p>If you have bookmarks in your browsers that you don't want to lose, you can export your bookmarks to a file and put them on the U: drive. See the instructions below for how to do it in <a href="#chrome">Chrome</a>, <a href="#firefox">Firefox</a>,
        and <a href="#ie">Internet Explorer</a>.</p>
